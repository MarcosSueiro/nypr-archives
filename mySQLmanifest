/*
This mySQL query 
run in cavafy
generates a table that is close to
the 'Core' schema on BWF MetaEdit,
as well as a couple of additional fields.

You can export it as csv (careful with the delimiters!)
or as xml and play with it 
as the start of a physical-item manifest.

Change the line 

WHERE title LIKE 'Listening Room%'

to whatever series you want to search, for example

WHERE title LIKE 'On the Line'
